### Key Process Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User drags PDF] -->|drop| B[Read file into input#pdf]
    B --> C[Update UI: "PDF Selected"]
    C --> D[Extract pages range from user]
    D --> E[Use pdf.js to extract text from PDF]
    E --> F{Extraction Success?}
    F -- Yes --> G[Display extracted text in textarea]

```

---

### Data Flow

- **Source:** Drag-and-drop or file input (`<input type="file" id="pdf">`)
- **Processing:** Text extraction via [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)
- **Destination:** Text area (`#text`) for the extracted content

---

### Key Functions

| Function        | Description                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pdfselected()` | Called when a PDF is selected. Updates UI and triggers text extraction.                  |
| `doo()`         | Sets up pdf.js worker and extracts text for selected page range.                         |
| `extractText()` | Uses pdf.js to extract text from the PDF, page by page, within the selected range.       |
| `pageindex()`   | Sets up the default page range in the UI after PDF is loaded.                            |
| `textentered()` | Prepares UI when text is entered manually instead of PDF.                                |
| `index_check()` | Validates and corrects the selected start/end page indices.                              |

---

### Notable Interactions

- **Disables/enables** the submit button and input fields based on extraction result.
- **Shows a modal loader** during form submission for user feedback.

---

## 2. `quiz_home.js`

### Purpose

Handles displaying and copying the quiz code, as well as generating a QR code for quiz access.

---

### Main Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Copy Quiz Code           | Enables users to copy the quiz code to clipboard.                          |
| Show Feedback            | Changes the `tag` attribute to indicate that code was copied.              |
| QR Code Generation       | Uses the [QRCode.js](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/) library to generate a QR code for the quiz link.|

---

### Example QR Code Generation

```javascript
var qrcode = new QRCode("qrcode", {
  text: url,
  width: 256,
  height: 256,
  colorLight : "#ffffff",
  colorDark : "#5868bf",
  correctLevel: QRCode.CorrectLevel.H,
});
```

- The `url` encodes the quiz ID and starts at question 1.

---

### User Journey

```mermaid
journey
    title User copies quiz code and shares link
    section Quiz Home
      User clicks code: 5: Copy event
      System copies to clipboard: 4: UI feedback
      User sees QR Code: 3: Easy sharing
